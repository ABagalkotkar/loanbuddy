FLOOD RISK
Flood risks in New Jersey are growing due to the effects of climate change. Coastal and inland areas
may experience significant flooding now and in the near future, including in places that were not
previously known to flood. For example, by 2050, it is likely that sea-level rise will meet or exceed
2.1 feet above 2000 levels, placing over 40,000 New Jersey properties at risk of permanent coastal
flooding. In addition, precipitation intensity in New Jersey is increasing at levels significantly above
historic trends, placing inland properties at greater risk of flash flooding. These and other coastal and
inland flood risks are expected to increase within the life of a typical mortgage originated in or after
2020.
To learn more about these impacts, including the flood risk to your property, visit
flooddisclosure.nj.gov. To learn more about how to prepare for a flood emergency, visit
nj.gov/njoem/plan-prepare/floods.

Is any or all of the property located wholly or partially in
the Special Flood Hazard Area (“100-year floodplain”)
according to FEMA’s current flood insurance rate maps for
your area?

[]

[]

110.

Is any or all of the property located wholly or partially in a
Moderate Risk Flood Hazard Area (“500-year floodplain”)

according to FEMA’s current flood insurance rate maps for

[]

[]

111.

Is the property subject to any requirement under federal
law to obtain and maintain flood insurance on the
property?
Properties in the special flood hazard area, also known as
high risk flood zones, on FEMA’s flood insurance rate
maps with mortgages from federally regulated or insured
lenders are required to obtain and maintain flood insurance.
Even when not required, FEMA encourages property
owners in high risk, moderate risk, and low risk flood
zones to purchase flood insurance that covers the structure
and the personal property within the structure. Also note
that properties in coastal and riverine areas may be subject
to increased risk of flooding over time due to projected sea
level rise and increased extreme storms caused by climate
change which may not be reflected in current flood
insurance rate maps.

[]

[]

[]

112.

Have you ever received assistance, or are you aware of any
previous owners receiving assistance, from FEMA, the
U.S. Small Business Administration, or any other federal
disaster flood assistance for flood damage to the property?
For properties that have received federal disaster
assistance, the requirement to obtain flood insurance passes
down to all future owners. Failure to obtain and maintain
flood insurance can result in an individual being ineligible
for future assistance.

[]

[]

[]

113.

Is there flood insurance on the property?
A standard homeowner’s insurance policy typically does
not cover flood damage. You are encouraged to examine
your policy to determine whether you are covered.

[]

[]

[]

114.

Is there a FEMA elevation certificate available for the
property?
If so, the elevation certificate must be shared with the
buyer. An elevation certificate is a FEMA form, completed
by a licensed surveyor or engineer. The form provides

critical information about the flood risk of the property and
is used by flood insurance providers under the National
Flood Insurance Program to help determine the appropriate
flood insurance rating for the property. A buyer may be
able to use the elevation certificate from a previous owner
for their flood insurance policy.
