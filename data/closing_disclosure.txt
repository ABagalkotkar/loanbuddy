Additional Information About This Loan
Loan Disclosures
Assumption
If you sell or transfer this property to another person, your lender
will allow, under certain conditions, this person to assume this
loan on the original terms.
x will not allow assumption of this loan on the original terms.
Demand Feature
Your loan
has a demand feature, which permits your lender to require early
repayment of the loan. You should review your note for details.
x does not have a demand feature.
Late Payment
If your payment is more than 15 days late, your lender will charge a
late fee of 5% of the monthly principal and interest payment.
Negative Amortization (Increase in Loan Amount)
Under your loan terms, you
are scheduled to make monthly payments that do not pay all of
the interest due that month. As a result, your loan amount will
increase (negatively amortize), and your loan amount will likely
become larger than your original loan amount. Increases in your
loan amount lower the equity you have in this property.
may have monthly payments that do not pay all of the interest
due that month. If you do, your loan amount will increase
(negatively amortize), and, as a result, your loan amount may
become larger than your original loan amount. Increases in your
loan amount lower the equity you have in this property.
x do not have a negative amortization feature.
Partial Payments
Your lender
x may accept payments that are less than the full amount due
(partial payments) and apply them to your loan.

account, you would pay them directly, possibly in one or two large
payments a year. Your lender may be liable for penalties and interest
for failing to make a payment.

monthly payment.

Estimated total amount over year 1. You
must pay these costs directly, possibly
in one or two large payments a year.

Escrow Waiver Fee

In the future,
Your property costs may change and, as a result, your escrow payment may change. You may be able to cancel your escrow account,
but if you do, you must pay your property costs directly. If you fail
to pay your property taxes, your state or local government may (1)
impose fines and penalties or (2) place a tax lien on this property. If
you fail to pay any of your property costs, your lender may (1) add
the amounts to your loan balance, (2) add an escrow account to your
loan, or (3) require you to pay for property insurance that the lender
buys on your behalf, which likely would cost more and provide fewer
benefits than what you could buy on your own.
